## Background

Having spent over 15 years in the Iranian education system, it has
been quite of an unpleasant experience. Students go through a very
brothersome process of studying for an University Exam called [Konkour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_University_Entrance_Exam), which is ruled by a big group of people looking to earn money off
poor students.

The concept of the Iranian Grading system becomes more prominent when
students enroll in a University academic program.

## The grading system

The grading system here is basically the same as [France's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_France).
The grading is done on a scale of 0-20. This is unlike some
other grading systems where letters are used to represent grades, i.e. A, B, C, etc.

In most cases, the precision of the grade has a precision of two decimal places.
Which means seeing grades like 18.23, 18.41 and such is pretty common.

# The issues

It has been quite a while since I have started my Bachelor's academic journey.
And I have started to notice some issues with the grading system.

## You can't precisely measure knowledge

The fact that the system has the precision of two decimal places
means that it claims that it is possible to _very precisely_ score
students. This is inherently a error-prone process because it
is impossible to completely examine the knowledge of students
based on a limited tools such as an final exam.

## Burn out

This is one of the issues that can be felt throughout the courses.
In the process of a course, you suddenly find yourself drifting
away from the real purpose of the courses. Instead of aiming to
learn the concepts, you suddenly find yourself forcing yourself
to get that extra 0.1 points. These accumalated strehtches have
personally caused me to subconciously start to avoid that subject
even after the course is over.

## Perfectionism

The existense of an ultimate "20" score that you can't really
achieve unless you have perfected the course inherently promotes
having a perfectionist mindset. This is unlike the letter grading
system where **a range of high scores is considered A+**.
