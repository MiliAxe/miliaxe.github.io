description: A message from a temporary North Korea
---

I am writing this while I am fully disconnected from the world.
Iran has been fully shut from the world after protests have
started to rise up. Aside from internet, SMS services are fully
shut off, and we can't even message relatives via that.

And no, we can't do any sort of proxying or TOR or any of that sort
we are COMPLETELY SHUT from the international internet. Equivalent of
pulling the cable of international internet from the routers. Something
like North Korea.

It feels like a forced internet detox. Except that we can't even
access services that were beneficial to us. I recently wrote about
[abusing LLMs](/posts/rise-of-ai-decline-of-authenticity) and this
feels like a detox from LLMs as well. I feel like a part of my brain
is missing. I guess this really proves that I was really offloading
too much of my brain tasks to LLMs. I am actually using my brain, and
it feels rather weird. And this is when actually learning things becomes
useful. The first thing I would do before internet was shut off would be
to consult an LLM when I didn't know how to do a thing.

Aside from using LLMs, I can't access anything unless I had them downloaded
beforehand. This includes books, music, movies and so on. Thankfully a dear
friend of mine, [Nima](github.com/nimaaskarian) had a good collection of books
and media that he could provide me, and I am very thankful for his kindness.

## The emptiness feeling

I would like to talk about this feeling more here. Because it is rather
weird. I feel like some sort of numbness or incapability to think. I wrote
about "missing thinking" and, I can feel it missing here. Maybe this whole
series of events will force me to do some thinking again?
