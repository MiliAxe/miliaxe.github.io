description: How the rise of LLMs have drastically changed my life for worse
---

It has been roughly 2-3 years since the first commercially available LLM has
been released to the public. I vividly remember the first hours of using GPT-3.
It was almost magical. It felt truly astonishing to have a chatbot that was
actually capable of understanding what I was saying.

But I never thought that would be the beginning of my self-doubt and a sense
of guilt and insecurity that I would carry on with myself after that.

As I said, it has been about 2-3 years since my first interaction with an LLM
and since then many more things have started to show up:

- Image generators: Midjourney, Google's Nano Banana...
- Music generators: Suno
- LLMs: Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2

They have kept improving over time, and we haven't reached a plateau yet. They
have become better at doing their job. LLMs now are capable of doing agentic
tasks where they interact with people's machine to view and modify the codebase
of its users.

Various "IDEs" have popped up, you just give them a prompt, and they get more
context if needed from your codebase to give you a relatively good result.
Examples are [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/agents)
and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/copilot). I have tried Antigravity and
Copilot extensively on my courses, I will probably write a post later on about
it. They get the work done. But I'm not here to talk about how good they are
here.

## The academic disaster

I have seen a lot of complications in the academic space with the
rise of LLMs. My university (at least) seems like hasn't really adopted to
students using LLMs. Students (including me) are abusing LLMs left and right to
write their homework and projects. Everyone seems to be vibe coding of some sort
just to _get their work done_.

There isn't much authenticity left nowadays on the campus. Everyone is an **LLM
wrapper** of some sort. Give them a task, and the first thing they do is consult
their LLM of choice.

Everyone is becoming mediocre, if we are all offloading our tasks to an LLM, we
are probably becoming the same thing, an LLM.

Professors and courses haven't found a way to deal with this yet. Maybe they
don't ever care to deal with it. Students refuse to do critical thinking and
actually engage with the material because they usually skip the thinking part
and leave it to the LLM.

I have been abusing LLMs for the last semester extensively, and I have started
missing thinking about a topic. I don't really remember the last time I actually
started deeply thinking about something. This is clearly my fault because I have
been abusing LLM to _not think_. But the problem is definitely is widespread.
Some don't even feel this.

Now let's imagine LLMs didn't exist. Abusing LLMs would exactly be equivalent to
paying someone to do your assignment and projects for you. Which is strictly
forbidden in the academic space. But the same thing is not frowned upon when we
use LLMs to do our work for us.

Abusing LLMs has lead me to feel helpless and shameful every day. Even though
I get my tasks done in courses. I might get good grades, but me knowing that
I didn't really do them myself makes me depressed and agitated. My work is
inauthentic, and they don't really represent me.

Here I point some possible causes for this
