For a quite time now, I have been going through a phase of nonchalance
or one can say, numbness. It is a state in which you cease to care about
certain things, or maybe everything.

This greatly hinders your productivity and health. You start to lose interest
in things that once made you happy and miss the things that once made you
happy. It's like going towards a blackhole, you slowly descend into it and
from a certain point, there is no return.

## How it starts

In my case, it started because I had set some unrealistic expectations for
university life. I had spent spend a huge amount of time in high school studying
for the university entrance exam and I thought that university is going to be
this very nerdy and fun place where I will meet like-minded people and have
a great time building nerdy stuff.

But that was all in my head. As time passed,
I realized all that I had in mind was just a fantasy. I constantly suppressed
this inner voice that wasn't happy with the way things turned out. It slowly
devoured me and I started to lose interest in everything that once I loved.

This is how it started for me. It can be different for others. It can be any
event in life.

## Is this copium?

Another thing that this might explain the phenomenon is that this might actually
be a natural respone in our brain. Our brain triggers this response when an
unfortunate event happens and the burden of it is too much too handle, this response
is triggered which might make it easier for the person to cope with the situation.

## How it affects life

Nonchalance can have different effects on people depending on their level of
nonchalance. For me, it affected my productivity and mental health severely.
Even though my university grades were good, I could not bring myself to do
other things that I liked to do like reading and even coding. My nonchalance
levels fortunately didn't affect my health (I managed to keep myself quite
healthy).

However, for some people, it can have effects on their health. This can be
addiction to ciggarettes, alcohol or even drugs. I haven't found any reason
for people to start smoking heavily other than this nonchalance that my mind
came up with. This is a topic on its own that I might want to write about in
the future. The nonchalance is keeping individuals from caring about themselves.

## Are these people weak?

Please do not think that these people are "weak" and thus you are "better than them".
You never know what people are going through. Maybe you would have ended up in the
same situation if you were in their shoes.

These people need guidance and help. They need to be assured that they are not alone
and there a way out.

## Is there a way out?

I am still trying to figure it out. I haven't completely gotten out of the situation.
I still can't get myself to wake up early in the morning and do the things I love/loved.
But I am trying (not my best, but I am trying). It is always important to know that
there is a way out. Just keep pushing through it.

Here are some things that I have found that might help you get out of this situation:

- **Just do the things you used to love**: I know it's hard, but just keep doing it.
  it is going to be hard, you will feel like you can't do it but just keep pushing.
- **Talk to others**: This one isn't really what I like but it might help you out.
- **Find the root**: It is always helpful to find what led you here. It might help you
  get out of the situation.
- **Exercise**: This can help you temporarily feel better. It is a good medication for
  keeping yourself sane.
- **Sleep well**: Not sleeping enough or sleeping late can make you feel even worse.
  Make sure to get enough sleep.
- **Forgive yourself**: It is okay to feel this way. It is okay to not be okay. Forgive
  yourself and keep pushing.

## Conclusion

Us humans go through a lot of things in life. We go through our personal downs and
ups. It is important to know that life is an uneasy journey and whatever we go through
is just a part of life.
