As I come close to the end of my 6th semester as a CE student, I can't help but
feel like an absolute useless and unskilled "Computer Engineer". I can't help
but feel like a person who has nothing original to offer.

I don't think this is exclusive to me. Our whole university is suffering from a
pandemic right now.

## The LLM pandemic

Since the appearance of LLMs in academia, All I see is students using it
to cheat. i.e. write their homework, cheat through exams. Everyone is relying
on it to progress their work and push it hard to "earn grades". It feels as
if the whole point of attending university nowadays is to have that _shiny grade_
in their GPA.

And the focus is no longer to learn new things related to computers. Only a few
care about it. Everyone else is just abusing LLMs to be over with the course.

As a person who has used LLMs to cheat through some parts of my courses, the
guilt felt from abusing LLMs is never-ending.

## Lacking originality

It feels as if me and every other student is just hooked on a drug called "LLMs".
The moment that drug is taken away, we fail to function normally. We just lose
a big piece of our thinking capability.

Students are barely thinking on problems themselves nowadays. They refuse to. They just
copy and paste the question to ChatGPT and call it a day.

This makes all the students just become a ChatGPT wrapper. We all just have become
a smart version of any other AI product that is merely a wrapper around an LLM.

This is a thing that I am dealing with nowadays. The pain that I suffer from
not being able to stop using LLMs and the constant guilt I feel from cheating
and just lazily going through courses with it just to be over with that course
is very bothersome.
