        I'm Mili (Milad Zarei), a junior Computer Engineering student.

        I'm interested in creating things that make life easier. Furthermore,
        I'm a fan of free software (free as in freedom) and I'm trying to reach
        my dream of contributing to the free software community.

## Current Setup

I use Arch GNU/Linux as my daily driver and I also use [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) as my window manager.
Switching to GNU/Linux has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Maybe one day I try out BSDs too.

_Edit: I have found out that the folk involved with suckless software seem to be [involved in right-wing/neo-nazi views](https://tilde.team/~ben/suckmore/).
Me using their software does not -- by any means -- imply that my beliefs align with their ideology._

### Interests

- GNU/Linux and Unix-like operating systems
- Automation that makes life easier
- Anything too nerdy and geeky (probably anti-culture too)

- [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning): Great content about low-level programming.

## Why this website?

Have you ever been looking for a specific thing you had in mind and you wanted
to know how to achieve it and you searched the whole _fancy looking websites_ but found
nothing but crap SEO farming content?

_Until..._

You found this beautiful blog that someone wrote that had the same geeky thing in mind
and that blog described the solution to the problem so beautifully that it helped you
find the solution to your problem and saved you a bunch of time?

Or maybe have you ever came across these beautiful blogs that people share their thoughts on?
(usually found on [medium](https://medium.com/) or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/))

Well, that is what initially inspired me to create a personal website. Maybe I can help out a single
soul on a specific topic. Plus, I think this is way better than sharing content on modern social media.
